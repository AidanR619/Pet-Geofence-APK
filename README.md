# Pet Geofence

Pet Geofence is a convenient system designed for pet owners to monitor and confine their pets within a designated area, either as a standalone solution or in conjunction with a physical fence. This is ideal for pet owners who desire outdoor freedom for their pets without the hassle of fence installation or containment challenges.

This is a project created by idan Rotz, Blaise Corcoran, Dustin Kramer, and Owen Fowles for the Software Engineering course from Kutztown University.
